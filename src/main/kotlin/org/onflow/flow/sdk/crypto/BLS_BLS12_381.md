### BLS_BLS12_381 Signing Algorithm

The BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) signature scheme on the BLS12-381 curve is a cryptographic algorithm used for secure and efficient digital signatures. This scheme is particularly useful for aggregating multiple signatures into a single signature, reducing storage and verification costs. Below, we explain the BLS_BLS12_381 signing algorithm and an overview of its input parameters.

The Flow JVM SDK implements supports key generation, serialization, and signing using the BLS_BLS12_381 algorithm. The implementation leverages the jpbc library for pairing-based cryptographic operations and bouncycastle for cryptographic primitives.

#### Input Parameters

- **q (BigInteger)**: This is a prime number that defines the order of the prime field (Fp) used in the elliptic curve operations.
- **r (BigInteger)**: The order of the elliptic curve group. This is the number of points on the elliptic curve.
- **h (BigInteger)**: The cofactor of the elliptic curve group. It is the ratio of the total number of points on the elliptic curve to the number of points in the subgroup of interest.
- **exp1 (int)**: Exponent used in the Miller loop during the pairing computation.
- **exp2 (int)**: Another exponent used in the Miller loop during the pairing computation.
- **sign0 (int)**: A sign parameter used in the elliptic curve operations. It is typically set to -1 for specific optimizations in the pairing computation.
- **sign1 (int)**: Another sign parameter used in the elliptic curve operations, similar to sign0.

The a1_3_512.properties file specifies Type A1 composite-order bilinear groups with three prime factors, each 512 bits in size. This file is utilized to instantiate the PairingParameters object within the SDK. By loading these parameters, the SDK is configured to perform pairing-based cryptographic operations with the defined bilinear group characteristics.
